     <p> Recent grad from Johns Hopkins with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics. At Hopkins, most of my work was research on movement disorders through motion analysis, sensor design, and machine learning. Most recently, I led a team in developing <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/news-events/news/parkinetics-improved-motion-data-collection-of-parkinsons-patients-in-everyday-life/">a new approach to measure people with Parkinson's</a>, providing insight into disease progression with only a few seconds of activity movement data.</p>
     <p> I've also spent quite a bit of time working with/for startups, through <a href="https://nucleate.org/">Nucleate</a> and other accelerators. See resume for more info on projects/work experience. </p>
